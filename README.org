+ [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DBHRbEAuquOqChHN2GqUR2uPKpW7D1Y-IBqMPM6TtM/edit?usp=sharing][Team Members]]
+ Open issues at https://github.com/IACS-cryo/IceBB/issues

But in general:  
+ Develop an IACS working group to develop a community standard for ice sheet and glacier ice boundaries and basins
+ Avoid mis-counting mass loss by different communities because regions are or are not included or excluded from both ice sheet and glacier communities
+ Support model intercomparison
