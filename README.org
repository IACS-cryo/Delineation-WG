* Introduction

This is a project for working on the Ice Basins and Boundaries (IceBB) project.

* Project goal

Goals are TBD based on community input
+ Community: See [[https://github.com/IACS-cryo/IceBB/issues/1][#1]] & [[https://github.com/IACS-cryo/IceBB/issues/2][#2]]
+ Goals: See [[https://github.com/IACS-cryo/IceBB/issues/3][#3]]
  
But in general:  
+ Develop an IACS working group to develop a community standard for ice sheet and glacier ice basins and boundaries
+ Avoid mis-counting mass loss by different communities because regions are or are not included or excluded from both ice sheet and glacier communities
+ Support model intercomparison
