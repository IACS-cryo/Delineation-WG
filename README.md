# IACS Working Group on the delineation of glaciers, ice sheets, and ice sheet basins

Project supported by the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences ([IACS](https://cryosphericsciences.org/activities/delineation-of-glaciers-ice-sheets-and-ice-sheet-basins)).

## Project goals

See:
- [CRYOLIST announcement](https://lists.cryolist.org/pipermail/cryolist/2022-November/008094.html)
- [Proposal](proposal/Ice%20Basins%20&%20Boundaries.pdf)
- [Team members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DBHRbEAuquOqChHN2GqUR2uPKpW7D1Y-IBqMPM6TtM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Organization

We aim to keep all discussions open as much as possible. We use [github discussions](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/discussions) for
brainstorming and Q&A, and [github issues](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/issues) for tasks and milestones.

Github might sound like it's for computer code only, but it's not!

## Status

The project just started! We will write a few more first steps here soon.
