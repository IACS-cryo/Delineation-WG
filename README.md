## Organization

We envision the bulk of the dialog occurring under the [discussions](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/discussions) section of this website, and actionable items distilled from the discussions will then be worked on under the [issues](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/issues/) section of this website.

+ [Discussions](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/discussions) is where we will work as a community to decide what to address and how to address it.

+ [Issues](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/issues) is where individuals or smaller groups or teams will work on specific actionable items, possibly linked to specific data features or code.

Github might feel overwhelming at first, but fear not! We won't use it for computer code only, but as a collaborative project management tool:

## Status

The project just started! Currently we are gathering ideas and brainstorming towards the first deliverable of the WG: 

*Deliverable 1: review report outlining the current situation, extracting the relevant 
information and suspected double counting in previous studies and IPCC report and 
proposed solutions to improve the situation.*

Let's [discus](https://github.com/IACS-cryo/Delineation-WG/discussions)!
